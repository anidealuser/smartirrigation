Basically this project helps farmers and city peoples a lot because farmers face a lot of problem in irrigation and even city peoples so implementing technology in that would really make a change , isn't it ?

ðŸŒ¾ Project Description

The Smart Irrigation System is a modern IoT-based automation project designed to make the process of watering plants intelligent, efficient, and effortless. This system uses an ESP32 microcontroller as the main controller, a soil moisture sensor to measure the moisture level of the soil, a relay module to control the water pump, and the Blynk app for cloud-based monitoring and control. The main objective of the project is to provide water to plants only when required, preventing both overwatering and underwatering while saving water, energy, and time.

The soil moisture sensor continuously senses the water content present in the soil. When the soil becomes dry, the sensor sends an analog signal to the ESP32 microcontroller. The ESP32 processes this data and decides whether the pump should be turned ON or OFF. If the soil is dry, the ESP32 activates the relay module, which in turn switches ON the motor or water pump to start irrigation. Once the soil moisture level reaches the desired value, the ESP32 sends another signal to the relay to switch OFF the pump, thus automatically maintaining the correct water level in the soil.

The system is connected to the internet using the built-in Wi-Fi feature of the ESP32. Through this connection, it communicates with the Blynk Cloud and updates the real-time soil moisture data. The user can open the Blynk app on their smartphone to check the moisture percentage, pump status, and other readings. The app also allows manual control, so the user can turn the pump ON or OFF from anywhere at any time.

This project is not only useful for farmers in agricultural fields but also for people living in cities who maintain home gardens or terrace plants. It minimizes human effort, ensures proper watering, and promotes the efficient use of water resources. By combining automation, sensing technology, and IoT connectivity, this smart irrigation system provides an innovative and sustainable solution for modern farming and urban gardening.
